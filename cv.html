<!-- Volunteering Experience -->
<li><p><h3>VOLUNTEERING</h3><b style="color: rgb(232, 207, 178);">camp counselor-</b>While being responsible,creative,innovative and reliable I had been overseeing children and educating them
through games. I created and led games and activities that helped the kids learn English in a fun way,
helped the kids work together, make friends, and enjoy the camp as a group,helped kids with their English,
giving them support when they needed and promoted camp values. </p><br><b style="color: rgb(232, 207, 178);">volunteer tutor-</b>I've been a volunteer educator for primary school students facing some challenges at school. I helped them
because they had a hard time learning by giving one-on-one learning experiences and small group classes.
Creating a good environment for learning should help them become much more confident about asking
questions.To do this, I worked closely with teachers to identify areas where students needed help. Based on
those areas I came up with ways to support and provide them help. </li>
